# Module-3-Challenge
The purpose of this election audit was to get a further break down on election results based on different counties. This will also help to determine which county is the largest based off of votes. This will help to get an underatanding of how the results turn out as they do. Breaking down data and understanding it can potenitally help in a different election so that officials can focus solely on different counties depending on if they data was positive or negative. The data was ran through Xcode as an .py file and then converted to a text file. 

The outcome of the election results is as followed:
There were a total of 369,711 
1. The largest county turnout of voters was Denver with 82.8% followed by Jefferson with 10.5% and Arapahoe with 6.7%.   
2. Based on the results, the winner was Diana DeGette with 73.8% and this is due to having the largest percentage of voters in Denver.

To help with elections in the future, the electoral commission should focus on certain areas in different counties to eliminate disparities and help with getting a larger percentage of people to vote. This will also help officials to be more active in certain counties based on percentages.
