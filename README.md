Data using python terminal
The purpose of this election audit was to get a further break down on election results based on different counties. This will help to get an underatanding of how the results turn out as they do. Breaking down data and understanding it can potenitally help in a different election so that officials can focus solely on different counties depending on if they data was positive or negative. 

The outcome of the election results is as followed:
1. The largest county turnout of voters was Jefferson County
2. Based on the results, the winner was Charles Stockham and this is due to having the largest percentage of voters in the area.

To help with elections in the future, the electoral commision should focus on certain areas in different counties to eliminate disparities and help with getting a larger percentage of people to vote. This will also help officials to be more active in certain counties based on percentages.
